//Syntax of Class

class ClassName

//Member declared here is considered private as well
private:
    //Declarations of private variables and functions, accessable from inside the class only
public:
    //Declarations of Public variables and functions

//if public and private are not written, members are private by defaults
};
//No memory is Allocated yet, class is only decelared
//Allocate memory by Creating objects similar to structs

//Typically data members are private for data protecetion, visible only by class
//And Functions are publc
